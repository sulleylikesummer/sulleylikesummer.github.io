		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<div class="container">
			<div class="col-md-8 about-info">
				<h3>Our Mission</h3>
				<p>We are committed to work with more ecological and environmental protection enthusiasts, industry experts and researchers to participate in environmental protection. </p>
				<h3>Our Vision</h3>
				<p>While adhering to scientific protection, MINTO adheres to the principle of multi-party cooperation and actively cooperates with all relevant organizations and personnel to jointly face the problems and challenges it faces. </p>
				<h3>Our Conservation Methods</h3>
				<p>Biodiversity, water and climate are the three areas that MINTO highly focuses on. Adherence to multi-party cooperation, science-based conservation methods and standardized analysis methods are the premises for MINTO to carry out all conservation activities. MINTO can effectively select objects and areas that need to be protected, formulate protection plans, and organize people to protect them.</p>
				<br><h3>Our Aim</h3>
				<p>To protect the animals, plants and natural communities that represent the biodiversity of the earth by protecting the lands and water that they depend on. </p>
				<h3>Our Credibility</h3>
				<p>As a public charity organization, MINTO has a public trust and accountability obligation to its members, the public and all those who participate in our efforts to protect the industry. MINTO has been highly praised by the public charity group.</p>
				<h3>Our Strategy</h3>
				<p>To introduce the importance of ecological protection to more people, we should not only rely on data and ICONS, but also integrate the knowledge of sociology, psychology, communication and other disciplines to interpret difficult scientific terms. We also build Ecosystem services function and People and ecological Protection to extend MINTO's rethinking of the interdependence between human and environment.</p>
